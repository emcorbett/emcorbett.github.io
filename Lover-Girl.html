             <p class="summary-lover">This piece is one of my most cherished works. "Lover Girl" is a drawing I made for my figure drawing class and I am so proud of it. This piece was my first fully rendered drawing of a full human figure, it took around 20 hours to complete and it was certainly a huge challenge for me. This piece truly made me fall in love with drawing the human figure and I have loved it ever since.  <br><br>
            The most difficult part of this project was pushing myself to have more contrast, I tend to be lighthanded with my shading but I wanted to see how much dimension in the body and forms I could acheive. Using white charcoal for highlights was also new to me, but I enjoy the way it looks on the toned paper.         </p>
