                "Study of Form" is a drawing that I undertook recently to improve my skills on anatomy and the human figure. I have drawn so many people but drawing humans in an interesting pose where the torso, legs, and arms are elongated is more difficult than a normal pose. Ultimately, I would love to work further on this piece to increase my contrast and create more realism in the work.  
            <br><br>
                Using human models in person or online is something I was originally very intimated by, only something I had seen experienced artists do. However, I am so glad I took that leap and discovered the world and community of figure drawing; it truly has been my favorite subject to draw.
