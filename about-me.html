            Hi! My name is Emma Corbett, and I am a graphic design student at Central Michigan University. I am extremely passionate about creating strong designs, branding, and any physical media; I love seeing how design and art can help connect and inspire people. </p>

            <br><br>

           <p class="about-me-summary">Over the past few years, I have worked on many student and freelancing projects, as well as gained many years of experience in the Adobe Creative Suite, which helped me build essential design skills. I am particularly interested in branding and logo designs, custom illustrations, visual identities, and business graphics. Outside of my professional workspace, I enjoy doing traditional media, specifically anatomy and figure drawing, playing with colors, or getting inspired by more artwork. I am always eager to learn and enhance my skills as a designer.
                                 </p> 
            <br><br>
        <p class="about-me-summary">
            Enjoy my work, and let's create something beautiful together.
